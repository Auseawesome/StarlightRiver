# Starlight River 0.2.5

## Balance
- Decreased the damage of auroracle's wavy ink projectiles in normal and expert mode
- Increased the amount of damage auroracle's tentacles take (1.25x => 1.4x)

## Fixes
- Fixed a bug where you could avoid auroracle's laser by running to the edge of the arena
- Fixed a crash that could occur with starsight and LuiAFK
